# Git-most-Important
Over here I want to show and explain what the most important things to know about git are (no need to memorize then, you only need to understand and and you will build mind memory with time).
As you have realised by now, commands can pile up pretty fast during cloud-Devops learning. This repos is therefore to keep the most importants, for me and for you, including what I think about them, as well as how I use them.
Feel free to suggest edits and raise concerns if any.
